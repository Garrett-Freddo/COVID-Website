# CoronaWebsite
An attempt at creating a contact tracing website for the COVID-19 pandemic.
This website uses Javascript, bootstrap, HTML, and the google Firebase Database
in order to create an interactive contact tracing website. This is still a work in progress.
So far what is implemented is the website UI, a verification email with a custom security code, and
a google firebase database that stores user information such as name, email, security code, 
and whether the account has been officially registered.
